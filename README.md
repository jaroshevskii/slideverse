# Slideverse

A modern sliding-tile puzzle (the classic *fifteen-puzzle*, generalized to 3×3 / 4×4 / 5×5)
for iOS 26, built with the [Composable Architecture][tca] and the [Point-Free][pf] ecosystem.

Originally a C++/raylib desktop game, Slideverse was re-implemented in Swift as a
**hyper-modular** SwiftUI app — with an optimal **C++ solver** still doing the heavy lifting
where native speed actually matters.

## Features

- **Three board sizes** — 3×3, 4×4, and 5×5, switchable on the fly.
- **Hint & Auto-solve** — an optimal IDA* solver (in C++) highlights the next best move, or
  animates the puzzle to completion. Available on 3×3 and 4×4.
- **Undo & Pause** — step moves back; pause freezes the timer and blurs the board.
- **Daily Challenge** — a date-seeded board that's identical for everyone on a given day.
- **Scoring, stats & streaks** — every finished game is persisted locally; the Stats screen
  shows best times per size, your high score, daily streak, and unlocked achievements.
- **Achievements** — First Win, Speedy (under 1:00), No Hints, Daily Devotee, Big Board (5×5).
- **iOS 26 polish** — zoom navigation transitions, `matchedGeometryEffect` tile sliding,
  `numericText` content transitions, SF Symbol effects, a grouped `Form` for Settings, and a
  confetti celebration on victory.
- **Settings** — light/dark/system appearance, sound effects, haptics, and default board size,
  persisted with `@Shared`.

## Architecture

Slideverse follows the **Point-Free Way**: pure logic in value types, side effects behind
controllable **dependency clients**, features as self-contained [TCA][tca] reducers, and a thin
app shell that composes them — the same modularization philosophy as [isowords][isowords].

| Module | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| **PuzzleCore** | Pure value types & rules: `Board`, `Tile`, adjacency, inversion-count solvability, scramble, scoring. No UI, no dependencies. |
| **CxxPuzzleSolver** | C++ target — optimal IDA* solver (Manhattan + linear-conflict heuristic). |
| **PuzzleSolver** | Swift C++-interop wrapper exposing `PuzzleSolverClient` (a controllable dependency). |
| **Models** | SQLiteData `@Table` records (`CompletedGame`, `Achievement`) + `bootstrapDatabase()` migrations. |
| **Settings** | `UserSettings` persisted via `@Shared(.userSettings)` file storage. |
| **AudioPlayerClient** / **HapticsClient** | `@DependencyClient` seams for sound and haptics. |
| **Styleguide** | Shared colors, fonts, and layout constants. |
| **GameFeature** | The game reducer + SwiftUI board: timer, moves, hint/auto-solve, undo/pause, scoring, persistence. |
| **HomeFeature** | Menu + How-to-Play. |
| **StatsFeature** / **SettingsFeature** | Stats dashboard and the grouped settings form. |
| **AppFeature** | Root reducer; owns `StackState` navigation and composes everything. |

### Dependency design

Every side effect is a small, testable client following the isowords pattern — defined with
`@DependencyClient`, registered on `DependencyValues`, with `liveValue` / `testValue` /
`previewValue` implementations. For example:

```swift
@DependencyClient
public struct PuzzleSolverClient: Sendable {
  public var solve: @Sendable (Board) async -> [Int] = { _ in [] }
}

extension DependencyValues {
  public var puzzleSolver: PuzzleSolverClient { … }
}
```

Reducers declare what they need (`@Dependency(\.puzzleSolver)`, `\.continuousClock`,
`\.defaultDatabase`, `\.haptics`, …), so tests swap in controlled implementations with zero
global state.

## C++ interoperability

The sliding-puzzle's one genuinely compute-heavy task is **optimal solving**, so that's the
only thing written in C++ — using [Swift's C++ interop][cxx].

[cxx]: https://www.swift.org/documentation/cxx-interop/

**`CxxPuzzleSolver`** exposes a C-style entry point (so no `std::` types cross the language
boundary), keeping `std::vector` internal:

```cpp
namespace slideverse {
  int solve(const int *tiles, int count, int size, int *outMoves, int maxMoves);
}
```

Inside, it runs **IDA\*** with an admissible **Manhattan-distance + linear-conflict** heuristic,
so the returned move sequence is provably optimal.

**`PuzzleSolver`** (Swift, built with `.interoperabilityMode(.Cxx)`) bridges it to a clean Swift
API and wraps it as a dependency that runs off the main actor:

```swift
public static func solution(for board: Board) -> [Int] {
  let tiles = board.tiles.map { CInt($0.number ?? 0) }
  var out = [CInt](repeating: 0, count: 1024)
  let produced = tiles.withUnsafeBufferPointer { t in
    out.withUnsafeMutableBufferPointer { o in
      slideverse.solve(t.baseAddress, CInt(tiles.count), CInt(board.size), o.baseAddress, 1024)
    }
  }
  return produced > 0 ? out.prefix(Int(produced)).map(Int.init) : []
}
```

### Keeping the solver fast

IDA\* time grows with the *optimal solution depth*. Full random permutations can be ~50+ moves
deep (seconds to solve), so gameplay scrambles by a **bounded number of random moves**
(`Board.scrambled(size:moves:)`) — this keeps the optimal depth small and solves sub-second.
The solver also has a node budget and returns "no solution" gracefully, and Hint/Auto-solve are
gated to ≤4×4 (`State.canUseSolver`).

### The interop cascade (build setup)

A clang module that `requires cplusplus` cascades up the import graph: **every** Swift target
that transitively imports `PuzzleSolver` must also enable C++ interop. In `Package.swift`:

```swift
.target(
  name: "GameFeature",
  dependencies: [/* … */ "PuzzleSolver"],
  swiftSettings: [.interoperabilityMode(.Cxx)]   // also: AppFeature, the test targets
)
// package-level: cxxLanguageStandard: .cxx17
```

The Xcode app target imports `AppFeature`, so it sets
`OTHER_SWIFT_FLAGS = -cxx-interoperability-mode=default`.

## Data & persistence

Game history is stored locally with **[SQLiteData]** (type-safe SQL via `@Table`, observed with
`@FetchAll`). The schema is created with `DatabaseMigrator` + `#sql` statements in
`Models/Schema.swift`, and the app installs it at launch:

[SQLiteData]: https://github.com/pointfreeco/sqlite-data

```swift
@main struct SlideverseApp: App {
  init() { prepareDependencies { try! $0.bootstrapDatabase() } }
  …
}
```

- **`CompletedGame`** — board size, moves, seconds, score, mode, day key, timestamp.
- **`Achievement`** — unlocked achievements (unique by key).

Stats screens read reactively with `@FetchAll`; the game writes results inside a reducer effect
wrapped in `withErrorReporting`.

User preferences use the **[Sharing]** library — a single `UserSettings` value persisted to disk
and shared app-wide via `@Shared(.userSettings)`.

[Sharing]: https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-sharing

### Scoring

```
score = max(0, boardSize² · 100  −  moves · 5  −  seconds · 2  −  (usedHint ? base/2 : 0))
```

## Tech stack

- **Swift 6.2**, **iOS 26** (package also builds for macOS so logic tests run on the host)
- The Composable Architecture · Dependencies · Sharing · SQLiteData · SwiftNavigation
- **C++17** via Swift/C++ interoperability
- Swift Testing (`@Test` / `@Suite`) + TCA `TestStore`

---

## Building & running

The app and the Swift package are integrated through `App/Slideverse.xcodeproj`, which
references the local package and links the `AppFeature` product.

```sh
# Build & test the package (logic, solver, persistence, reducers) on the Mac:
swift build
swift test

# Build the iOS app:
xcodebuild -project App/Slideverse.xcodeproj -scheme Slideverse \
  -destination 'generic/platform=iOS Simulator' build
```

Or just open `App/Slideverse.xcodeproj` in Xcode and run — the local Swift package resolves
automatically, and the database bootstraps on launch.

---

## Testing

Tests live alongside each module and run fast (the solver suite scrambles by bounded moves so it
stays well under a second):

- **PuzzleCoreTests** — moves, adjacency, win detection, inversion-count solvability, scoring.
- **PuzzleSolverTests** — the solver's output, applied to a scramble, reaches the solved state
  (3×3 / 4×4 / 5×5).
- **ModelsTests** — migrations create the schema; inserts round-trip.
- **GameFeatureTests** — `TestStore` coverage for undo, pause cancelling the timer, hint,
  and a winning move persisting a game + unlocking achievements.
